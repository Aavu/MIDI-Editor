# MIDI Editor

MIDI Editor is an open-source project with the aim of building a simple lightweight MIDI file player and editor (in development). The player supports [General MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_MIDI) 1.0 spec. It uses the [GeneralUser GS MuseScore v1.442](http://schristiancollins.com/soundfonts/GeneralUser_GS_1.442-MuseScore.zip) soundfont file from [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/soundfonts-and-sfz-files#list) to generate sounds. You can check out the [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFSt7ScsCPo) (Please Turn ON Captions for explanations).
